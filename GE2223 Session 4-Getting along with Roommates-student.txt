Getting along with
Roommates

Scenario
You find it hard to get along with your roommate
in the student hostel. You often need to work late at
night, but your roommate sleeps early. You know
he/she is unhappy with even dim light and the tiny
keyboard typing sound you make, and you have
been tolerating the dissatisfaction apparent on
his/her face. And you never complain about his/her
door slamming in the morning while you are asleep.
One day when you return from class, you see an A3
paper posted on the wall. It prints “Be Considerate.
Stay Quiet After 11:00p.m.” You are really annoyed.

Role-Play
The moment you are reading the “notice”,
your roommate comes in, definitely seeing
you reading the notice. What are you going to
say or do?

Role-play the scenario according to your
teacher’s instructions.

Concepts to Learn
• Personality
– Structure of self
– Value systems

• Empathy and perspective taking

Self-reflection
• What “define” who you are?
Examine each of your sentences:
• To what extent is your self-description private
to you? To what extent is it known to others?
• To what extent is your self-description about
who you really are? To what extent is it about
your ideal?

Personality as self concepts
Your personality can be understood
as a structure of self…
I am …

So, how does the way
I am known to be …
you see yourself affect
your reaction to your
I should be …
roommate?
I want to be seen as…

… because your concepts of self affect
how you think, feel, and behave.

Personality as values
Further, does the way
you see yourself tell
what you care about?

I am …
I am known to be …
I should be …

What are your values
I want to be seen as…
that affect the way you
react to your roommate?

Values
• Values are core beliefs that influence how we act. Our values
support the choices we make in life. (Corey & Corey, 2014:372)
• Your values influence what you do; your daily behavior is an
expression of your basic values. (Corey & Corey, 2014:384)
• It’s essential that you beware of the significant impact your
value systems have on your relationships with others. (Corey &
Corey, 2014:384)

• It’s not appropriate for you to push your values on others, to
assume a judgmental stance towards those who have a different
view, or to strive to convert others to adopt your perspective on
life. (Corey & Corey, 2014:384)
• If you are secure in your values and basic beliefs, you will
not be threatened by those who have a different set of beliefs
and values. (Corey & Corey, 2014:384)

Take time to reflect on your values
What are your core values? To identify some of your values,
rate the importance of each of these items using the scale:
3 = This is extremely important to me.
2 = This is somewhat important to me.
1 = This is not important to me.

Being other-Oriented
• Being other-oriented involves a two-step process:
• 1. social decentering (consciously thinking about
another’s thoughts and feelings) and
• 2. empathizing(responding emotionally to another’s
feelings).
• To improve your ability to socially decenter and to empathize,
strive for two key goals:

• 1. Gather as much information as possible about the
circumstances that are affecting the other person
• 2. Gather as much information as possible about the

other person
• (Beebe et al., 2011:81)

Adaptive to the differences
• There are cultural differences among the world’s
people, including differences in language, food
preferences, housing preferences, and a host of other
elements.
• to adapt to cultural differences in order to understand
others better

• be other-oriented rather than self-absorbed
• (Beebe et al., 2011:37)

Empathy and perspective taking
Empathy
is the ability to
experience how another
person feels, or the
ability to spontaneously
identify with another on
a direct emotional level.

Perspective taking
is the ability to
cognitively take another
person’s frame of
reference for
understanding the
person’s self, situation,
or feeling state.

Effective Communication

Try Using Empathy to Construct the
Roommate’s Version of this Story:
You find it hard to get along with your roommate
in the student hostel. You often need to work late at
night, but your roommate sleeps early. You know
he/she is unhappy with even dim light and the tiny
keyboard typing sound you make, and you have
been tolerating the dissatisfaction apparent on
his/her face. And you never complain about his/her
door slamming in the morning while you are asleep.
One day when you return from class, you see an A3
paper posted on the wall. It prints “Be Considerate.
Stay Quiet After 11:00p.m.” You are really annoyed.

Reacting with Empathy
• Your roommate has been rather depressed lately.
Even though he/she does not say anything, you know
something must have happened to him/her.
It seems to me that you
are unhappy lately, do you
want to talk about it?

I feel worried about you
because you look sad.

I guess you must be going
through something tough.
What is it?

How can we improve our empathy?
For perspective taking
•Resist our own
egocentric tendencies to
define the other’s
experience on our own
terms.
•Ask others to verbalize
their perspectives and
then probe for details.

For empathy
•Remind yourself to
pay attention to the
spontaneous emotional
expressions of others
(nonverbal cues)
•Communicate more
expressively yourself

How can we improve our empathy?
• To start practising, the easiest way is to
practice asking about feelings:

“What are your feelings about X?”
“How do you feel when you do X?”
• And listen to the response very attentively
• listen with your heart.

More about empathy?
• Empathy: The ability to identify with or vicariously
experience the feelings, thoughts, situation, or attitude
of another individual  understanding and
acknowledging other’s situation, thinking, attitude,
feelings and needs
• Empathy  effective communication
•  mutual understanding
• acceptance of individual differences /embracing
diverse perspectives (harmony with diversity)
•  mutual respect
•  resolve interpersonal conflicts
• foster positive interpersonal relationships

More about empathy
Note:
• Empathy (同理心) ≠ Sympathy (同情心)
• Understanding (體諒) / acceptance ≠ approval
(your acknowledgement and understanding of other’s
perspective, values, thoughts, attitude and act etc.,
does not necessarily equal agreement/approval)
• (體諒並不一定代表同意對方的觀點/行為)

Conclusion
• The roots of interpersonal conflicts are very often
simply differences between people that arise from
different personalities and cultural backgrounds.
• Conflicts are always reciprocal. Never believe it is
only the other person’s fault.
• React with empathy. Think and feel from the other
person’s perspective before you judge and act.

Conclusion

•

When we appreciate, the good grows.
When we don’t appreciate, the good depreciates.
There is no perfect relationship, no perfect person, etc.
The important thing is to focus on what is working
Appreciate it so that it appreciates
So many people wonder why they are not happy enough even
though they have all the things that they want in their lives. Why?
Because there can be too many of a good thing. e.g., two pieces of
your favourite music play together noise
• To cultivate relationships means to invest in them, to put time into
them, to share, and to open up.
• Movies end when love begins. It’s about cultivating the relationship
after the screen comes down after the sun sets; that’s where the
investment and the return on investment come. (Tal Ben-Shahar)

Conclusion/For further reflection
• The “Golden Rules”: A Universal Value???
• e.g., Hinduism:
• This is the sum of duty: Do nothing to others that would cause pain if done
to you.
• Buddhism:
• One should seek for others the happiness one desires for oneself.
• “Consider others as yourself.” (The Buddha)
• Confucianism:
• Is there one principle that ought to be acted on throughout one’s whole
life? Surely, it is the principle of loving-kindness: do not unto others what
you would not have them do unto you./ Do not do unto others what you
would not have done unto yourself. (己所不慾,勿施予人)
• (Beebe et al., 2011:37)

“己所慾,施予人,”對嗎？

Conclusion/For further reflection
• The “Golden Rules”:
• Christianity:
• “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.” 你
們願意人怎樣待你們、你們也要怎樣待人。(Luke (路加福音),
6:31)

• “So in everything, do to others what you would have them
do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.” 所
以無論何事、你們願意人怎樣待你們、你們也要怎樣待人
．因為這就是律法和先知的道理。(Matthew (馬太福音), 7:12)
• Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Have love for
your neighbour as for yourself (愛人如己). (Matthew (馬太福音),
22:39)
• (Beebe et al., 2011:37)

Conclusion
• The Platinum Rule:
• “Do to others as they themselves would

like to be treated.” (Milton Bennett, a Communication researcher )
• Rather than treat people as you would like to be
treated, interact with others how you think they
would like to be treated. [Don’t impose your own
values/views upon others! Don’t project your own
feelings onto others!]

• to be other-oriented (Beebe et al., 2011:114)
