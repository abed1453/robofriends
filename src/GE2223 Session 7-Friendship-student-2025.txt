Concepts to Learn
– Listening skills
– Giving and receiving feedback
– Nonverbal communication
– Communication Barriers

Scenario
Your friend Chris looks depressed. You ask
Chris what happened, and Chris says he/ she
had failed to do perfectly in a very important
interview. Chris keeps self-criticizing and is
pessimistic about his/ her future. Chris also
keeps telling how he/she could have done
better in the interview. You want to help, but
how?

Chris
How can I be so stupid? I’ve been preparing for this
interview for a whole week and ruined it. Just one stupid mistake:
one single, careless, huge, unforgivable mistake! I’ve studied the
company’s background for a week and got its history mixed up!
Do you think I am stupid? Do you? Yes. I am stupid because I
am now over-reacting! I know I should be more optimistic, but I
can’t believe I made such a mistake.
(Silence)
When the interviewer asked me what I knew about the
company, I was so confident – over-confident! But then, I only
appeared arrogant. You know, the most stupid thing is you think
you are great, but you’re doing something obviously wrong.
How stupid was I? (pause) Maybe I should be more positive.
(Silence)
But I feel so bad about myself now…
Feel free to elaborate while you role-play

Role-Play
You are now talking to Chris. Try your best
to 1) show your empathy and 2) your care
and support for Chris in a way you think
how a good friend should be like. Chris
should, however, be as depressed and
pessimistic as possible.
Role-play the scenario according to your
teacher’s instructions.

How to listen actively?
Active listening involves four steps:
•1. identifying the facts and feelings being
expressed;
•2. assessing the intensity of the feelings;
•3. selecting an appropriate "feeling" word for
response that accurately expresses the emotion
and intensity of the speaker's feelings; and
•4. phrasing the feedback message.

How can we improve empathy?

Listen with your heart
(用心聆聽聆聽別人的整個訊息)
Listen with ears –what is being said, and what tone is used?
(用耳朵聆聽–留意對方說話的內容及語氣)
Listen with eyes –what is the person’s body language while
speaking? (用眼睛聆聽–留意對方在說話期間的身體語
言)
Listen with heart –how do the others feel? (用心聆聽–留意
對方的感受)
Better understanding  more empathy  effective
communication with more respect

Listening skills
• What does your friend need when he/she
talks to you?
– Is it a solution to the problem?
• You can:
– Offer a solution; or
– Offer emotional support so your friend
can regain the strength to find his/her
solution.
• By active listening, you are offering
emotional support.

What is listening?
Element of
Listening
Hearing

Attending
Understanding

Responding
Remembering

Explanation
The physiological aspects of listening involve
sound waves striking the ear at a certain
frequency and volume.
Attention is focused on some messages and
filters out others.
The listener must interpret the messages
similarly to the way the sender intended them.

The listener gives observable feedback to the
sender.
The listener is able to recall the content and
meaning of the messages at a future time.

Listening skills: Phrasing
Different ways
of phrasing

Explanation

Content

It is more effective you paraphrase the sender’s
message than making interpretation or repeating.

Depth

Respond seriously to a serious statement; and lightly
to a shallow statement. Responses that match the
sender’s depth of feeling or lead the sender to a
slightly greater depth of feeling are most effective.

Meaning

Pay attention to the meaning conveyed. Do not add
or omit meaning. Reflect your understanding and
check whether you are right or wrong.

Language

Keep it simple to ensure accurate communication.

What can and can’t a good friend do?
A good friend can:

Because you lack the skills to do it properly?

Giving feedback
•Point 1:
•Give an objective description of
the behavior you’ve observed;
Give descriptive, not evaluative or
judgmental feedback;
Be prompt; timing is important;
Be concrete and specific;
Use I-statement;
Check whether your friend
understands your feedback.

Giving feedback
•Point 2:
•Consider your friend’s needs as
well as your own;
Avoid being egocentric; (be otheroriented!)
You are in the process of learning
about your friend; don’t assume
you are always right.
By caring for your friend’s needs,
you are already giving support.

Giving feedback
•Point 3:
•Give positive as well as negative
feedback;
 Give positive feedback; it offers your
friend additional strengths;
 Give negative feedback; it helps your
friend think more critically;
 It is usually good to start with positive
feedback.
 Look at the bright side of your friend’s
weakness (and point it out to your
friend).

Giving feedback
•Point 4:
•Direct your feedback at
behavior that can be changed;
Feedback is helpful only when it
relates to something the other
person can control;
Feedback is useless when it
concerns personal attributes or
opportunities that have already
been missed.

Activity
Is this feedback helpful?

• “I’ve told you that you should wear black suits in
interviews.”
• “They don’t want to hire you because you live too
far away from the company.”
• “They don’t want to hire you because you have no
experience in the field.”
• “You better arrive 15 minutes earlier next time.”
• “I think it is always good to look up more
information about the company before you attend
the interview.”
• “Do you think the other candidates in the
interview are better than you?”

Activity
Is this feedback helpful?
• “I’ve told you that you should wear black suits in interviews.”
I-statement, focus on behavior, but may not be objective,
should provide scientific support.
• “They don’t want to hire you because you live too far away from the
company.”
Objective but cannot be changed.
• “They don’t want to hire you because you have no experience in the
field.”
Objective, although cannot be changed, but can be worked on.
• “You better arrive 15 minutes earlier next time.”
Focus on behavior, workable, but could be better if I-statement was
used.
• “I think it is always good to look up more information about the
company before you attend the interview.”
I-statement, focus on behavior, objective.
• “Do you think the other candidates in the interview are better than
you?”
Not helpful; unless further discussion on how to improve and do better
next time is developed.

All I Have Are Negative Thoughts - Joker 2019 Scene

• In the movie, Arthur complained to his
counsellor:
• “You don't listen, do you?”
• [Note: To be an effective communicator,
“listening” is the No. 1 essential requirement;
listen with not only our ears, but also our
eyes, hearts, undivided attention (one) whole mind, body & soul, and mouth – give
appropriate feedback!]
• “I don’t think you ever really hear me.”
• [This reminds us that we need to be attentive
and focused, not being distracted,
sidetracked or preoccupied with other
things in our mind.]

Listening
All I Have Are Negative Thoughts - Joker 2019 Scene
1 ½ -min video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFrdpsILBv4&feature=youtu.be

• In the movie, Arthur told his counsellor:
• “You just ask the same questions every week.”
• [To respect the person and be effective in
communication, we have to remember what the person
has told us and show him/her that we’re really
interested in what he/she said and that we care for
him/her. In Cantonese, we say “上心” – put what the
person told us, put his/her concern in our hearts, i.e.,
genuine care and concern.

Active Listening
• indicates to the speaker that his
or her message has been received
by the listener;
• indicates that the listener has accurately (or inaccurately)
perceived the intensity of the feelings that the speaker has
on the subject;
• legitimizes the fact that having and expressing feelings is
acceptable;
• encourages the speaker to share more of his/her feelings
and perhaps promote some form of cathartic release; and
• builds feelings of empathy and care between the speaker
and the listener. (Extracted from SS2201 Course Pack, 2022:11)

Benefits of Active Listening
Active listening:
•enables the listener to
verify whether he or she
has accurately perceived
the intensity of the
speaker's feelings;
•aids the listener in
understanding the speaker's
Carl Rogers
“Experiences in Communication”
feelings; and
•builds rapport between the listener and the speaker; and
•de-escalates the intensity of the dispute because the speaker feels that he or
she has been heard. (Conflicts often escalate in intensity because speakers
feel that the listener has not heard how strongly the speaker feels about the
subject.)(Extracted from the SS2201 Course Pack, 2021:11)

Benefits of Active Listening
• “When someone really hears you without passing judgment on
you, without trying to take responsibility for you, without trying
to mold you, it feels damn good. . . .
•

• When I have been listened to and when I have been heard, I am
able to re-perceive my world in a new way
and to go on. It is astonishing how
elements which seem insoluble become

soluble when someone listens.
• How confusions which seem irremediable
turn into relatively clear flowing streams

when one is heard.”
~ Carl Rogers, “Experiences in Communication”

Benefits of Active Listening
Mutual Growth/Recovery
“I believe I know why it is satisfying to me to hear
someone. When I can really hear someone, it puts me in
touch with him; it enriches my life.
It is through hearing people
that I have learned all that I
know about individuals, about
personality, about interpersonal
relationships.”
Carl Rogers
“Experiences in Communication”

Concluding on Listening
• The crucial and necessary elements for
effective interpersonal communication:• Listening
• Listening with genuine care and concern for
the person
• Listening with our whole body, especially our
ears, eyes, head, heart, and mouth, with full
attention and respect for the person.

Describe your own feelings, rather than
evaluate the behavior of others
Most people don’t like to be judged or evaluated.

Criticizing and name calling obviously can
create relational problems, but so can attempts to
diagnose others’ problems or win their affection
with insincere praise. (Beebe et al., 2011:172)

Dealing with communication barriers
According to Carl Rogers (1961), the main barrier to
effective communication is our tendency to evaluate
and judge the statements of others. He believes that
what gets in the way of understanding another is the
tendency to approve or disapprove, the

unwillingness to put ourselves in other’s
frame of reference, and the fear of being changed
ourselves if we really listen to and understand a person
with a viewpoint (p.214) different from our own. (Corey &
Corey, 2014:214-215)

Dealing with communication barriers
Rogers (1961:32) suggests that the next time you get
into an argument with your partner your friend, or a
small group of friends, stop the discussion for a
moment and institute this rule: “Each person can

speak up for himself only after he has
restated the ideas and feelings of the
previous speaker accurately, and to that
speaker’s satisfaction.” (Corey & Corey, 2014:215)

The Speaker-Listener Technique
(Show this video in class if time allows)
~ 4 ½-min video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1_cixgjVH4

The Speaker-Listener Technique
• Each person takes turns speaking while his or her partner
listens and paraphrases what the speaker said. The following
rules will make things clearer.
General Rules:
• 1. The speaker has the floor. If you're the listener, follow the
rules below for the listener and wait for your turn to be the
speaker. Use an object, such as a pen, to show who the speaker
is.
• 2. Share the floor. Take turns letting each person be the
speaker.
• 3. Don't problem-solve. Focus on having a good discussion,
not finding a solution.

The Speaker-Listener Technique
Rules for the Speaker:

Rules for the Listener:

• 1. Speak for yourself. Don't read your
partner's mind. Express your feelings and
thoughts, using "I“ statements to express
your point of view.

• 1. Paraphrase what you
heard. Repeat back what you
heard in your own words to let
your partner know you
understand what they are saying.
Wait till your turn as the speaker
to ask more questions.

• 2. Be brief. Don't go on and on each
time. You will have plenty of time to talk
about everything on your mind as you
take turns.
• 3. Stop and let the listener
paraphrase. After you've spoken for a
short while, let your partner paraphrase
what you just said. Help him or her
understand your point of view. If the
paraphrase is not entirely accurate,
politely restate what you meant.

• 2. Focus on the speaker's

message. Don't rebut.
Remember: your job is to listen
and understand what your
partner is saying. Wait till you
are the speaker to offer your
own opinion.

Discussion and reflections on
“communication experiment”
Carrying out this experiment requires that you strive to genuinely
understand another person and achieve his or her
perspective. It can be extremely difficult to put into
practice.
It involves challenging yourself to go beyond what you find
convenient to hear, examining your assumptions and
prejudices, not attributing unintended meanings to
statements, and not coming to quick conclusions based on
superficial listening.
If you are successful in challenging yourself in these ways, you can
enter the subjective world of the significant person in your
life; that is, you can acquire empathy, which is the necessary

Be a quiet, compassionate listener
Resist the temptation to fix
• Bobby Schuller (30-5-2015), in his sermon entitled “Heal
like Jesus,” says:
• “One of the greatest ways that you can be a healing
presence in the world around you is just to be a
quiet, compassionate listener.”
• Pastor Bobby Schuller reminds us: “You can't fix

people. Fixing is for machines. People need to be
healed. ”
•  so we need to have empathy
• we have to resist the temptation to fix people

Listen First
• Pastor Bobby Schuller (30-5-2015), in his sermon entitled “Heal
like Jesus”, continues:

• You don't have to do much, really, to heal others.
You just have to care. Sometimes you just have to
listen. And you’ll notice when you listen to the suffering of
others and you empathize and you feel their pain, you’ll see
something turn in them where all of a sudden they’re ready

for encouragement. Don't encourage them at first.

Listen first. And then, when they seem to have received
healing, that’s when you say, “You can do it. You have a bright
future. I believe in you. I see something great in you.” You really
can change people's lives.

More about advising
• There are times when suggesting a
solution is appropriate.
• If, for example, my friend is struggling with
procrastination, it may be useful for me to share
my expertise in this area—but only after I
have listened to him.
• (Ben-Shahar, 2011:184)

More about advising
Immature advice is often counterproductive.
• The person may feel not listened to, not understood
by his/her friend; may even perceive that his/her
friend is insincere and just offers perfunctory

solutions/advice to end the conversation in a
hurry to get rid of him/her by handing out quick
fixes.

Avoid Giving Advice
Another problem with advice is that the advisor seldom
understands the full implications of the problem. When
people share their concerns with us, they often display
only the “tip of the iceberg.” The advisor is
unaware of the complexities, feelings, and many
other factors that lie hidden beneath the surface.
(Bolton, 1979)

More about advising

• What's wrong with advice? Advice is often a basic
insult to the intelligence of the other person. It
implied a lack of confidence in the capacity of the
person with the problem to understand and cope with
his or her own difficulties. As Norman Kagan puts it, "In
essence, we implicitly say to someone, 'You have been
making a "big deal" out of a problem whose solution is
immediately apparent to me - how stupid you are!'"
(Bolton, 1979)

More about advising
• While coming up with solutions to a friend’s problems may
make us feel helpful and competent, it often has the
opposite effect on the friend.
• 1. offering solutions creates distance between two people:
one person is in the know (above), the other is in trouble
(below).
• 2. the person being helped feels inadequate, especially
when he is already feeling weak.
• 3. When we offer solutions, regardless of our intentions, the
message often comes across as condescending and
paternalistic.
• It is not always easy to refrain from giving advice. Usually,
simply being there is sufficient. (Ben-Shahar, 2011:183)

Avoid Giving Advice
Working with; NOT working for
• It’d be more empowering to the person if we collaborate with
them to work out their own solutions instead of readily

handing out straightforward advice/solutions to clients.
• As a proverb goes: Give a man a fish and you feed him for
a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a
lifetime. (“授人以魚不如授人以漁” -- 《老子》)
• It’d be more empowering to teach a man fishing than to give him fish.

The body language signals to tell if they REALLY
like their Christmas present
• It’s all in the body language
• Giving and receiving gifts is bloody nightmare, fraught with
indecision, dashed hopes and unease as you struggle to work out
whether the person you’ve gifted actually likes their present/ attempt
to fake joy yourself.
• In fact, according to a survey of 2,000 Brits by gift card company
One4All, 65 per cent of people confessed to pretending to like a gift to
avoid hurting someone’s feelings.
• But this Christmas it’s all change, as Dr Simon Moore, chartered
psychologist with the British Psychological Society, has spilled the
beans [爆料]on the body language giveaways which tell you how
someone REALLY feels about their Christmas gift.

Conclusion
• Often, listening offers what your friend needs
better than giving advice.
• Active listening means putting your egocentric
concern aside and trying to take the other
person’s perspectives.
• When you give feedback, stay empathic, focus
on facts, and controllable behaviors, attend to the
bright side, and state your opinion as your
subjective opinion (rather than the truth!).
