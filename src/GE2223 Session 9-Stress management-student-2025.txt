Stress: an angel or a devil?
Some people may think that stress is something
negative that needs to be got rid of. In fact, an
adequate level of stress can enhance our
efficiency and performance in our work,
study or other areas in our life. Stress can
motivate us to strive in pursuit of our goals,
to seek for solutions to our problems, and to
improve the situation where we are in.
Nevertheless, when the stress level is too
high, we can no longer demonstrate our
abilities and potential as usual. Our work
efficiency and performance would be
hampered accordingly. Worst still, under
prolonged stress, our [physical and]
psychological health would be affected
negatively. (Source: Institute of Mental Health/Castle Peak
Hospital/HA) (http://www3.ha.org.hk/cph/imh/mhi/article_01_02.asp)

壓力：是天使還是
魔鬼？
有些人可能以為壓力是一
些負面和必須設法鏟除的
東西。其實，適量的壓力
可以推動我們朝著自己的
目標努力，提高我們在工
作、學業或生活各方面的
效率和表現。適量的壓力
亦促使我們正視問題，尋
求方法解決，以改善自身
的處境。然而，當壓力過
大時，我們不單不能夠將
自己固有的能力發揮出來
，降低了工作效率和表現
之餘，長期受壓甚至會令
自己的身心健康受到影響

Definition of Stress


A psychological and physical/physiological response of the
body that occurs whenever we must adapt to changing
conditions, whether those conditions be real or perceived



The inability to cope with a perceived threat (real or
imagined) to one’s mental, physical, emotional, and
spiritual wellbeing, which results in a series of
physiological responses and adaptations. (Seaward, 2012:3)



The important word to emphasize here is perceived (the
interpretation), for what might seem to be a threat to
one person may not even merit a second thought to
another individual. (Seaward, 2012:6)

Cognitive Appraisal
 It is a process of analyzing and processing

information and categorizing and organizing
it.
 Appraise the severity of the threat
 Appraise your ability
 Appraise the consequence…

Type of Stress
Eustress: Good stress; any
stressor that motivates an
individual towards an optimal
level of performance or health
(Seaward, 2012:9)

Stress that results in positive
consequences such as enhanced
performance or personal growth
(Greenberg, 2013:116)

• The optimal amount of stress
which helps promote health and
growth. (it is motivating and
inspiring.)
• Not all stress is bad for you.
When stress serves as a positive
motivation, it is considered
beneficial.

HK Tertiary Institutes Health Care Working Group, 2018

Type of Stress
Distress: The unfavorable or negative interpretation of an
event (real or imagined) to be threatening that promotes
continual feelings of fear or anger; more commonly
known simply as stress (Seaward, 2012:9)
Stress that results in negative consequences such as
decreased performance and growth (Greenberg, 2013:115)


Stress due to an excess of adaptive demands placed upon
us. Thus, this is the BAD stress



Results when the demands upon us are so great that they
lead to bodily and mental damage. Distress is
damaging, excessive or pathogenic (disease producing)
stress.

Stress & Performance
Just like the strings of a guitar, if the strings are too loose,
they can’t make music; too tight, they break down.

The Yerkes- Dodson Curve: stress can be productive & have positive
consequences – increase performance. Stress can also have negative
consequences – interfere with performance. (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908 in
Greenberg, 2013:117)

Performance
According to the Inverted UThe optimal

When stress is too low, we may

Sources of Stress
Environmental sources of stress
Many of the stresses of daily life come from external sources.

e.g.1: You may have difficulty arranging your work schedule to
fit your school schedule, and this can be compounded by the
external demands of friends and family and other social
commitments.

e.g.2: Financial problems and the pressure to work to support
yourself (and perhaps your family too) make being a student a
demanding task.

e.g.3: Test anxiety

e.g.4: Illness, exposure to environmental pollutants, improper
diet, lack of exercise, poor sleeping habits

e.g.5: Racism, oppression and discrimination

Sources of Stress
Psychological sources of stress






a) Frustration - stress due to any situation in which
the pursuit of some goal is disillusioned. Frustration
is usually short-lived, but some frustrations can be a
source of major stress.
1) Failures - we all fail. But, if we set unrealistic
goals, or place too much emphasis on obtaining
certain successes, failure can be devastating.
2) Losses - deprivation of something that you once
had and considered a "part" of your life. This can
result in tremendous stress.

Sources of Stress
Psychological sources of stress

b) Conflict occurs when two or more incompatible
motivations or behavioral impulses compete for
expression. When faced with multiple motivations or
goals, you must choose, and this is where the
problems/conflicts arise.

Studies have indicated that the more conflict a person
experiences, the greater the likelihood of anxiety,
depression, and physical symptoms.

Sources of Stress
Three major types of conflicts


1) Approach-Approach Conflicts: a choice must be made between two
or more attractive or desirable alternatives. Such conflicts are inevitable because
we have a limited amount of time to do all the things we would like to do and be
in all the places we would like to be. An example of this type of conflict is
being forced to choose between two job offers, both of which have attractive
features.



2) Avoidance-Avoidance Conflicts: a choice must be made between
two or more unattractive or undesirable outcomes. These conflicts are the
most unpleasant and the most stressful. You may have to choose
between being unemployed and accepting a job you do not like, neither of
which applies to you.



3) Approach-Avoidance Conflicts: a choice must be made involving
two or more linked outcomes, each with attractive and unattractive elements.
For example, you may be offered a challenging job that appeals to you but that
entails much travelling, which you consider a real drawback. (Corey & Corey,
2014:140)

Sources of Stress



c) Change can exacerbate stress, especially life changes
that involve readjustment in our living circumstances.
1) Holmes & Rahe (1967) - developed the Social
Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) to measure life
changes.
While BIG changes like the death of a loved one are
very stressful, small life changes have tremendous
effects.
Studies using the SRRS have indicated that people with
higher scores tend to be more vulnerable to many
different physical and psychological illnesses.

can be worked out by adding up the
scores for each event experienced
over 12 months.
If a person has less than 150 life
change units, they have a 30%
chance of suffering from stress.
150 - 299 life change units equate to a
50% chance of suffering from stress.
Over 300 life units mean a person has
an 80% chance of developing a
stress-related illness.

Student Stress Scale (College-age adults)
A total value for stressful life events can be worked
out by adding the scores for each event
experienced over 12 months.
If your score is over 300 or higher, you’re at high
risk for developing a health problem.
If your score is between 150 and 300, you have a
50-50 chance of experiencing a serious health
change within two years.
If your score is below 150, you have a 1 in 3 chance
of serious health change. (Reference: Holmes and Rahe, 1967 in
Blonna, 2012:116-117)

Sources of Stress
Psychological sources of stress
 d) Pressure - expectations or demands that one
must behave in a certain way.
 e.g., I am under pressure to perform in
particular ways in front of a class as a
"teacher".
 Striving to live up to the expectations of
others, coupled with self-imposed
perfectionist demands, is a certain route to
stress (Corey & Corey, 2014:140) ( Leslie Cheung’s
suicide).

5 Ps in triggering and perpetuating
mental health problems
Presenting problem – This goes beyond the diagnosis to include how the person’s
life is affected…
Predisposing factors – biological/genetic endowment, environmental factors (e.g.,
socio-economic status, trauma, attachment history), psychological or personality
factors (e.g., core belief, maladaptive cognitions, personality factors)
(vulnerability)
Precipitating factors – stressful life events (trigger the onset of a mental disorder)
Perpetuating factors – personality, maladaptive cognitions, poor
interpersonal/familial relationships, lack of resources (maintain or perpetuate
the current difficulties)
Protective/Positive factors – protective factors moderate the impact of stressful life
events (e.g., social support, coping abilities, hardy personality – liking for the
challenge, a strong sense of commitment, internal locus of control); strengths or
support that may mitigate the disorder.
(make reference to Macneil et al., 2012:2)

Protective factors moderate the impact of stressful
life events/stress (like a fraction 分數)
(Numerator 分子)

Presenting problem
(Denominator 分母)

We cannot change our genetics. At times, some life events are beyond our locus of
control. In other words, we cannot prevent them from happening to us. But we can
address our life experiences directly, e.g., how we interpret the experiences, to live
with the “problems” or deal with them, whether or not to seek external support to
help us combat them …
Change is still possible! We still have a choice! So be hopeful!
We aim to reduce the perpetuating factors and to strengthen/increase the
protective/positive factors to mitigate the adverse effects of stressful life events
(precipitating factors), etc. and thus reduce the negative impact of the
presenting problem…



Somatization and Chinese
It is the term used to describe patients’ heightened
awareness of their bodies and their presentation of
somatic complaints in place of psychological complaints
(Kleinman, 1977:5)



It is “the substitution of somatic preoccupation for
dysphoric affect in the form of complaints of physical
symptoms and even illness.” (Kleinman, 1980:149)



In such cases, physical complaints are expressed but a
corresponding organic lesion cannot be detected, or such
complaints are amplified so that symptomatology and
perceived disability exceed what would be expected from a
particular lesion. (Kleinman, 1982:170)

Somatization and Chinese
 In Hong Kong, Cheung referred to somatization as 

“the presentation, complaint, or manifestation of
somatic symptoms that relate to psychological
or emotional problems.” (Chueng, 1985:287)



“singly or in combination as a psychiatric
disorder and/or various patterns of illness
behaviour including the subjective experience,
the presentation, the communication, and the
form of help-seeking related to bodily
symptoms.” (Cheung, 1995:158)

Effects of Stress
Stress has powerful effects on the following:
mental functioning
 mental, physical and work performance
 interpersonal encounters, and
 physical well-being
 The Principles of Internal Medicine reported that 5080% of all physical disorders have psychosomatic or
stress-related origins.
 Most notably, coronary heart disease, cancer, the
common cold, migraine headaches, some cases of
female infertility [stress can also affect male’s sex
function], ulcers, insomnia, hypertension …


Effects of Stress
Overstress will make us sick.
Brain


Fatigue, aches and pains, crying spells, depression, anxiety attacks, sleep
disturbance.

Gastrointestinal Tract


Ulcers, cramps (腹部)絞痛/胃抽筋) and diarrhoea, colitis (結腸炎), and
irritable bowel.

Glandular System


Thyroid gland malfunction.

Cardiovascular


High blood pressure, heart attack, abnormal heartbeat, stroke.

Skin


Itchy skin rashes.

Immune System


Decreased resistance to infections and neoplasm (tumour/cancer).

(Make reference to Greenberg, 2013:40-60; Corey & Corey, 2014:141)

Stress Responses
Cognitive Appraisal - process of analyzing and processing
information as well as categorizing and organizing it.


At the cognitive appraisal level we put labels on things - good,
bad, dangerous, pleasant, etc.



Appraisal is influenced by personal history/experience, personal
beliefs, morals, resources/support, personal ability, faith,
internal/external locus of control, adversity quotient,
personality (optimistic? pessimistic? Type A? Type B? hardy
personality?), mode of thinking (any cognitive
errors/distortion??), etc.



We all make personal appraisals of situations and it is these labels
that determine our stress level and stress response.

Stress Response:
When we perceived
under threat, our body
reacts it for preparing to
fight or flight:• Rapid breathing
• Increased sweating
• A sudden rush of
strength
• Slowed digestion
• Increased heart rate
and blood pressure.
(Blonna, 2012:6, 127)

Locus of Control

External

Internal

 Locus of Control: A sense of who or what is in

control of one’s life (Seaward, 2012:155)
 refers to the extent to which individuals believe
that they can control events that affect them.
 Internal and external locus of control is not so
much a typology but rather a continuum: a person
can fall anywhere along that continuum from
external at one end to internal at the other.
 Most people are clustered somewhere in the
middle.

Locus of Control

External

Internal

External Locus of Control
 Certain people (externals) feel that external forces and
events, such as chance, fate, luck, powerful figures in
authority, or other external circumstances, control the
outcome of their efforts.
Internal Locus of Control
 Internals are convinced that control is an internal matter
related to their own efforts and talents.
 They believe that their behavior is guided by their
personal decisions and efforts.

Locus of Control

External

Internal

Internal Locus of Control:
 Believe they are the controllers of their own fate.
 They believe the outcomes stem mainly from internal
factors, e.g., their effort, ability, and decisions.
 In a stressful situation, they believe they can
significantly affect the results. They tend to act in ways
to take control of events and experience less stress.

Locus of Control

External

Internal

External Locus of Control
 See themselves as pawns of fate.
 Believe that the outcomes in their lives are determined
largely by external causes, e.g., fate, luck, actions of
others. less likely to take action to control their
lives, since they believe such action to be fruitless
 In a stressful situation, they are more likely to be
passive and defensive.
 Rather than doing something to reduce the stress, they
acquiesce.
 More likely to feel helpless and experience stress.

Locus of Control

External

Internal

 Those with a high internal locus of control have

better control of their behaviour
 They are more likely to assume that their efforts
will be successful.
 They are more active in seeking information and
knowledge concerning their situation than do
externals.


(make reference to Greenberge, 2013:190-191)

Locus of Control

External

Internal

 People with an internal locus of control take

responsibility for their actions; those with an
external locus of control place responsibility on
external factors like luck or the weather; the latter
is associated with the helpless-hopeless
personality, a stress-prone personality. (Seaward,
2012:155)

Type A & Type B Behavior
Cardiologists Friedman & Rosenman (1959,
1974 in Smith, 2012:1) proposed that behavior
patterns of speed, impatience, perfectionism,
drivenness, and hostility increased individuals’
vulnerability to heart disease. They later
labelled this constellation of traits associated
with coronary disease “Type A behavior” and
distinguished it from an oppositional counterpart
termed “Type B behavior,” reflecting a
relaxed, easy-going, slower-paced lifestyle.

Type A personality & heart disease
The Type A Personality involves self-imposed stress
and intense reactions to stress.
 Type A people were found to be three times more
likely to experience coronary heart disease.
 Type B people were much less likely to develop heart
disease.
 Type A behaviour is characterized by feeling a chronic
sense of time urgency and by an excessive
competitive drive.
 A type A individual is "aggressively involved in a
chronic, incessant [constant] struggle to achieve
more and more in less and less time."


Type A Behavior undermine life quality
 Type A behavior undermines subjective

wellbeing and erodes one’s capacity to enjoy
life.
 Type A behavior - a continuous struggle, and
unremitting attempt to accomplish or achieve
more and more things or participate in more
and more events in less and less time,
frequently in the face of opposition—real or
imagined—from other persons. (Friedman & Ulmer, 1984
in Smith, 2012:1)

Type A person should focus more on processes
and less exclusively on outcomes to reduce stress








The Type A component of time urgency compels Type As to move
rapidly from situation to situation in pursuit of instrumental goals.
The context of vacation enjoyment and time urgency might make it
harder for Type As to “stop and smell the roses,” live in the
moment, and fully savor positive experiences.
Type As actually find relaxation and leisure activities stressful
(Friedman & Ulmer, 1984 in Smith, 2012:1).
Like my experience of climbing Huangshan (黃山the h), I was
too task-oriented to reach the hotel on the other side of the ill
before sunset and did not stop to appreciate the beautiful
scenery.

Type A person should focus more on processes
and less exclusively on outcomes to reduce stress
 Bobby Schuller: “

Many of us oftentimes
ruin the joy that we could have in our
lives because we’re impatient. Impatience
is one the world’s biggest happiness
killers. We’re constantly going, moving,
moving, moving, and so because of that,

few of us truly experience joy in our
lives, and that’s no good.” (Bobby Schuller: You don’t
have to hurry, you can trust Jesus/Hour of Power/HK 6-3-2016 & 6-8-2016 )

Type A person should focus more on processes
and less exclusively on outcomes to reduce stress


Type As show higher levels of adrenaline secretion and report greater
distress during periods of inactivity compared to Type Bs (Frankenhaeuser,
Lundberg, & Forsman, 1980 in Smith, 2012)





Type As may be more likely to multitask in an effort to accomplish more
tasks in less time (Friedman & Ulmer, 1984).
Because multitasking divides attention simultaneously across multiple
unfinished tasks, as a result Type As may be less able than Type Bs to
attend to positive experiences and savor the moment (Bryant & Veroff,
2007).







(Savoring, defined as the capacity ‚to attend to, appreciate, and enhance the

positive experiences in one’s life (Bryant & Veroff, 2007, p. 2))
Type As’ tendency toward perfectionism (Flett, Hewitt, Blankstein, & Dynin,
1994) may increase their tendency to focus on faults in positive
experiences, thereby undermining enjoyment. (Make reference to Smith, 2012:4)
 Type A persons are vulnerable to stress!

“You cannot be both in a hurry and be kind. …You cannot be in a hurry and be
loving to others. This is why 1st Corinthians, the first thing when it starts to
describe love, what’s the first word? Love is – patient! The dictionary term for
patient is: able to accept or tolerate delays, problems or suffering without becoming
annoyed or anxious. … If you can’t do that, you can’t be loving because love is
patient. Love is unhurried. Love is present. Love is not regretting yesterday.
Love is not thinking about the next thing. Love is not focusing on tomorrow. Love
is not trying to use this moment to get something for myself or to get some kind of
achievement or reach a goal. Love is simply being present and caring. Love is
patient. Love is unhurried.
So many of us, our relationships are eroding because of hurry. We wonder why
things aren’t going well with our kids or our spouse or our parents or our
colleagues or the people that used to be our friends. Very often it’s because
whenever you’re with them, you’re not really with them. You’re hurried. You’re
thinking about getting to the next thing. You cannot be hurried and be loving at the
same time. You have to be slow. You have to be relaxed and then loving people
will be easy. ”

Hardy personality: buffers effects of stress


Dr. Suzanne Kobasa et al. (1979, 1981, 1982, 1983)
found three specific personality traits that collectively
act as a buffer to stress and contribute to what Kobasa
called the hardy personality. (Seaward, 2012:156)



Commitment: The dedication to oneself, one’s work,
and one’s family that gives the individual a sense of
belonging. Commitment involves an investment of one’s
values and life purpose to the growth of one’s human
potential and is a direct reflection of one’s willpower.
(Seaward, 2012:157)

Hardy personality: buffers effects of stress


Control: In this sense, control means a sense of personal
control, a sense of causing the events in one’s life
rather than a feeling of helplessness. Self-control, or
empowerment, helps one overcome factors and elements
in one’s environment so that one does not feel
victimized.



Challenge: The ability to see change and even problems
as opportunities for growth, in Kobasa’s mind,
symbolized a hunger of the heart that serves as an
inspiration. Challenge can also be viewed as a sense of
adventure. (Seaward, 2012:157)

Social Support: a protective factor


Social support is seen to be crucial.

 Some stress experts envision stress occurring

when there is not enough social support
available to respond to the event effectively.
(Greenberg, 2013:8)


Having a group of family members or close
friends in regular contact has a positive effect;
while the “loner” is much more likely to suffer
from ill health – both physically and mentally.

Social Support : a protective factor

Social support is belonging, being accepted, being loved, or being
needed. it is having people you can really talk to, to whom you
feel close, and with whom you share your joys, stressors, problems,
apprehensions, and love.
Social support comes in many different forms: 1. tangible support
(e.g., $); 2. emotional support (e.g., love or caring concern); and 3.
informational support (e.g., facts and advice). (Greenberg, 2013:163)
(also make reference to Blonna, 2012:48)

How social support moderates stress
1. Being cared for and loved and having the opportunity
for shared intimacy.
 2. Being esteemed and valued and from this gaining a
sense of self-worth.
 3. Having a sense of belonging through shared
companionship, communication, and mutual obligations
with others.
 4. Having informational support from others that
includes not only access to information but advice and
guidance.
 5. Having a safety net (access to physical or material
assistance) (Blonna, 2012:85)


How social support moderates stress


The above five components work together to moderate
stress in the following ways:

1. They provide a direct, protective effect that prevents
potential stressors from becoming actual stressors.
 2. They buffer and reduce the severity of the effects of
stress once the stress response occurs.




(Blonna, 2012:85)

Social Support: Stress Buffer Theory


The Stress Buffer Theory suggests that social support
helps after a stressor is encountered to help prevent that
stressor from resulting in negative consequences.
(Greenberg, 2013:164)



Social support may take many forms. E.g., it could be
emotional support to help you feel better about
yourself or about the event as you cope with it, or it
could take the form of financial assistance. In any case,
social support helps you cope with the event and
therefore decreases your level of stress. (Greenberg, 2013:8)

The Value of Human Touch
A benefit of social support: Human touch
 Touching, whether skin to skin or through clothing, is a
primary mode of communication and an integral form of
social support.
 Being touched, whether through a passionate embrace, a
peck on the cheek, a cuff on the head or shoulder, holding
hands, giving a message, or a tousle of the hair,
communicates love, intimacy, value, and worth as a human
being.
 Touch in a sense reinforces our perceived social support


(Blonna, 2013:85)

do more human contact in the real world instead of in
the virtual world/using i-devices

Physical exercise = powerful psychiatric drugs
John Ratey, Harvard Medical School professor, psychiatrist: “In a
way, exercise can be thought of as a psychiatric dream treatment.
It works on anxiety, on panic disorder, and on stress in general,
which has a lot to do with depression. And it generates the release
of neurotransmitters – norepinephrine (正腎上腺素), serotonin,
and dopamine – that are very similar to our most important
psychiatric medicines. Having about of exercise is like taking a little
bit of Prozac [for treating depression] and a little bit of Ritalin [for
treating ADD/ADHD], right where it is supposed to go.”
 the exact right amount of it. The exact right location and without
side effects or with side effects – positive side effects physical as
well as mental and emotional side effects

 Exercise  endorphins (腦內啡)reduce

Physical exercise
Six important criteria:
 1. the activity must be done for at least an hour per day
 2. the activity must be done on a regular basis
 3. the activity must have a base of 6 months of training
 4. the activity must be well liked by the person doing it
 5. the activity must be noncompetitive
 6. the activity must be done alone, or perhaps with one
other person (Seaward, 2012:518-519)

Doctors in Scotland can now prescribe nature
Oct 15, 2018

The evidence for the benefits of nature on mental and physical health are numerous. If you
spend 90 minutes of your day outside in a wooded area, there will be a decrease of activity in
the part of your brain typically associated with depression. Spending time in nature not
only reduces blood pressure, anxiety, and increases happiness, but it reduces
aggression, ADHD symptoms, improves pain control, the immune system, and—per a
summary of research regarding the health benefits of nature—there's much more we don't
know and are figuring out every day.

Ecotherapy (Green Therapy)
How nature can support recovery and wellbeing
Scottish Recovery Network, 21st February 2017. https://outlook.office.com/owa/projection.aspx

“now ecotherapy is rapidly becoming more popular, and is beginning to prove itself as a healthy way to
recovery, sustainable and cost-effective, with few if any negative side effects.” [Patsy’s personal medicine:
Nature – her natural mood stabilizer, which is free of charge, always available and without side effects, as Patsy said.]

There are many approaches to and methods of ecotherapeutic work. … ranges from:
Individual and group psychotherapy sessions which take place in suitable outdoor locations.
Exploring wild places and green spaces through ‘mindfulness’ exercises which involve sitting, standing, walking

talking and writing, paying close attention to the surrounding environment and to thoughts, emotions and sensations in
the body.
Guided walks where participants share knowledge of the ecology, beauty and wonder of the natural world around
them.
Art, craft and drama activities which use natural materials and/or record or express perceptions of the place
where they happen. [e.g., Hebe and Daisy’s group session in Tsuen Wan Park; Cash and Shadow’s group session on
a breach]
Bushcraft and survival activities which empower participants to work with nature while building a skills base, which
in turn builds confidence and a sense of healthy self-reliance.
Games which encourage the use of all the senses, stimulate the imagination, encourage group bonding and give rise
to laughter and light-hearted play.
Activities which restore and protect the ‘more-than-human’ world. These take the form of what is commonly known
as ‘conservation’ or ‘regeneration’ work.
Gardening and horticultural activities [e.g., Candia’s group at a hostel for MH people] which involve growing
food for healthy eating, flowers for beauty and a variety of plants that attract and support a range of wildlife, from
bees to butterflies to birds. (Retrieved on 30-8-2022, from https://outlook.office.com/owa/projection.aspx)

Benefits of Ecotherapy
The benefits of ecotherapy encompass physical, mental, and spiritual rejuvenation. Here are just a few of
the benefits that have been documented.
•Lower Stress – Many studies have shown that time spent in nature results in a reduction in cortisol, also
known as the stress hormone.
•Reduce Social Isolation – By participating in a group setting of ecotherapy such as care farming or
conservation efforts.
•Build Confidence – Wilderness camps are well known for increasing a person’s feelings of self-worth
and confidence to tackle any given challenge. Students learn practical survival skills. They use these
skills to solve problems on their own as well as within a group.
•Foster Trust – Team building exercises like participating in a ropes course or rock climbing teach
individuals to rely on each other. Animal-assisted therapy is another method used to build trust is
•Reduce Risk of Depression. Increased exposure to sunlight and Vitamin D levels can improve your
immune system and mood. Low levels of Vitamin D have been linked with depression and Seasonal
Affective Disorder.
•Improve Focus – Taking field trips or encouraging time spent outdoors during the day are two ways
teachers can improve children’s attention span in the classroom.
•Increase Motivation to Exercise – Exercise can occur in many forms, from gardening in your backyard,
walking with a friend outdoors, or going for a bike ride. Enjoying time outdoors can often serve as a
distraction, so people spend more time being active without even realizing it.
•Improved Relaxation – Many hospitals encourage a walk through their gardens for patients. Hiking
through a forest or meditating in nature are excellent ways to leave the modern world’s stressors
behind. (Retrieved on 30-8-2022, from https://www.ecotherapyheals.com/what-is-ecotherapy/)

Natural treatment for depression:
Phototherapy (light therapy)


Some clinicians reasoned that exposure to bright light might slow
melatonin (退黑激素) production in individuals with seasonal
affective disorder (SAD)



In phototherapy (or light therapy), most patients are exposed to 2
hours of very bright light immediately on awakening. If the light
exposure is effective, the patient begins to notice a lifting of moods
within 3 – 4 days (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004:312)
Sunlight can increase serotonin & suppresses the release of
melatonin which in excess can cause depressive disorder  seasonal

Light Therapy

• Beneficial in clients with seasonal affective disorder.
• Light therapy increases the serotonin levels and suppresses the release of
melatonin which in excess can cause depressive disorder.
• Involve exposure to an artificial light source, a light box.
• The light box should be able to provide 10,000 lux of illumination at a
comfortable sitting position with a UV-filtered light diffusion.
• Harmful ultraviolet light is filtered out.
• The light exposure is most effective before 8 am.
• Exposure time ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours in some studies.
Response begins in 1-4 days and full effect is achieved after 2 weeks

Journal writing
Expressing oneself through journal writing is a highly
effective means to help cope with stress.
 Journal writing: - provides profound internal vision and enhance the
self-awareness process in times of stress.
 - initiates the communication of self-reflection between
the mind and the soul, the necessary first step in the
resolution and closure of perceived stress.
 - is a vehicle for meditation. As a technique to clear the
mind of thoughts (by either focusing on one particular
theme or jotting down random thoughts as they surface
and circulate through the conscious mind), a calming
effect takes place as thoughts and feelings are transferred
from the mind to the written page. (Seaward, 2012:246)


Journal writing

Research suggests that journal writing is not only good for
the soul, as a mode of catharsis to express the full
range of emotions, but has proven to be good for the

- may serve as an emotional catharsis by getting out on paper the
toxic thoughts roaming through one’s head
- allows the release of thought, feelings, and perceptions that
liberates the mind and softens or expands the walls of the ego
- a writing mediation process – because as old thoughts are
permitted to leave, the empty space they once occupied allows for
expanded awareness of one’s internal landscape as well as
expanded depth of thought. Increased awareness opens the door
for increased understanding of ourselves in our many
environments. (Seaward, 2012:247)

Journal writing


Writing down personal thoughts gives one
permission to let them go, no longer thinking
about them with the intensity that may have
cluttered the mind and drained energy. (Seaward,
2012:247)

Release of thoughts and feelings may also act as a
personal confession, an honest confrontation of
one’s behaviors. (Seaward, 2012:247)
 And this is an initial step toward healing both one’s
internal relationship and personal relationships
with others. (Seaward, 2012:248)


Purposes of journal writing
1. to act as personal sounding board; to cleanse the
mind overloaded with perceptions, emotions, and toxic
thoughts.
 It is a great way to vent anger.
 Sometimes writing how you feel, and perhaps what you
should have said or would like to say, becomes a draft
script to resolve issues between you and the person(s)
involved in your perceived stress.
 Writing down feelings of anxiety and apprehension is a
good release of emotions that can drain your energy.
 Effective coping involves the ability to access and employ
both internal and external resources. (Seaward, 1994:174

Purposes of journal writing
2. to map out strategies for resolution.
 Journal writing can be used as a postponed coping
response, perhaps at the end of the day, to collect your
thoughts and process major events – those chronic
stressors – that need attention.
 A periodic review of journal entries serves to increase
awareness of trends and patterns in your thoughts and
behaviors.
 Recognition of trends is the first step in changing
undesirable or negative thoughts and actions in an effort
to reach your highest human potentials and enjoy inner
peace. (Seaward, 1994:174-175)

Time management
 The prioritization, scheduling , and execution of

daily responsibilities to a level of personal
satisfaction.
 Effective time management does not mean you
have more time;
 it means you make better use of the time you
have.


(Seaward, 2012:327)

Time-Management Techniques:
Prioritization
 Prioritization


Ranking responsibilities and tasks in their order of
importance.

a. The ABC rank-order method
 A= the highest-priority activities (must do immediately)
 B= second-priority activities (anything that is not A or C
but should do soon)
 C= low-priority tasks or things you would like to do (can
wait to do)




(Seaward, 2012:331)

Time-Management Techniques:
Prioritization
b. Importance-versus-urgent methods
 Divide your responsibilities for the week into the 4
boxes.
 Attention and efforts should go toward items listed in
Box I because they are high in both importance and
urgency.
 Next your efforts should go towards Box II because
these responsibilities are important but not quite urgent,
followed by those items listed in Box III (urgent but not
important), and finally those in Box IV (not urgent nor
important).

Recall
Session 3

The 80/20 rule (The Pareto Principle)

This principle is named after Italian economist Vilfredo
Pareto, who observed the 80/20 phenomenon—that, in
general, 20% of the population of a country owns 80% of
the country’s wealth, that 20% of a company’s clients
generate 80% of its revenues, and so on.
 The principle has been applied to time management by
Richard Koch and Marc Mancini, who suggest that we can
make better use of our time by investing our efforts in the
20% that will get us 80% of the results we want to
achieve.
 In 20% of our time, we can get 80% of our work
done. (Make reference to Ben-Shahar, 2011:32-34)


Recall

The 80/20 rule (The Pareto Principle)

Not all tasks are equally important, and not all require
equal attention.
 20% of focus on what’s important and got the 80% of
the work done.




Note: All of us have different time during the day when we are
most productive. In 20% of the day, we get 80% of our work done,
depending on whether we are morning people or night people.

Exercise:
 Think about your 80/20 allocation of time.
Where can you do less? Where do you want to
invest more?

Mental Relaxation
Falling Leaf
 Stare at a point on the wall across from you. Visualize a
leaf at that spot. With each breath, count backwards
from 20 to 1 as you watch the leaf very slowly drifting to
the ground. At 1, the leaf reaches the ground and you
are very deeply relaxed.


Ten Candles
 Close your eyes and imagine a row of ten lit candles in
front of you, any style or color. Ad you exhale, imagine
yourself blowing out one of the candles. With each
successive breath, blow out each candle and let yourself
become more deeply relaxed with each one. When all
the candles are out, let yourself enjoy the peace and
quite of the room.


 聖嚴法師說： 「解決困境的主張『接受它、

面對它、處理它、放下它。』」
面對它：正視困境的存在。
接受它：接受困境的事實。
處理它：以悲智處理困境。 （以慈悲對人，用智慧對事。）
放下它：處理後心無牽掛。 ( 放下自在。）

Conclusion:
The Serenity Prayer
 God grant me the serenity

to accept the things I cannot change;
courage to change the things I can;
and wisdom to know the difference.
-- Reinhold Niebuhr (American theologian (1892–1971). )
 求你賜給我心境坦然之恩，去接受我所

不改變的事情，有勇氣去改變我能夠改
變的事情，並且知道這兩者的區別。

Be hopeful: Whatever
Inculcation
of hopeyou’re
: going through …

Whatever you're
going through, …

Be hopeful
Be flexible

Conclusion
 Whatever (difficult, painful situations)

you’re going through, this too shall

pass!
 Do believe in your strengths and
resilience. You got the ability to
rebound!
