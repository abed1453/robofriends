Handling family tension

Scenario
At the beginning of your university life, you
slept in a student hostel on weekdays and
returned home on the weekend. However, as
you get busier and busier, you need to stay on
campus more often during weekends. You feel
guilty about spending so little time with your
parents but see no way to change the situation.
Today you call your parent and say that you are
working on campus this Saturday night for a
group project. Your mother bursts into a rage.
She accuses you of being irresponsible for the
family and says you must join the Saturday
dinner because your aunt is visiting.

Concepts to Learn
• Concepts about self
– Family value

• Communication
– Two-way communication
– Verbal communication

• Transactional Analysis

Parents’ influence on the
development of their children
• According to Virginia Satir (1991), parents
expect the children to want and like the
same things the parents do.
• It implies that parents want their children to
finish or to achieve the dream that they
were not able to achieve.
• (make reference to : Satir, V. (1991). The Satir model: family therapy and
beyond. Palo Alto, CA: Science and Behavior Books.)

Family values
Father And Mother I Love You?
How about Auntie?
• Different people see the importance of family
differently because people need family to a different
extent and for various reasons.
• And what defines “family” in your view?

Family values
• Reflect on how high you place your family in
terms of its importance.
• And how high do your parents see family?
• What makes the difference?

Is this
picture your
ideal?

Family values
Ultimately, why do you need a family?

A Family Is Like
© Nicole M. O'Neil, Published: February 2006
https://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/a-family-is-like-a-circle

A Family is like a circle,
The connection never ends,
and even if at times it breaks,
in time it always mends.

With endless words that show
who they are and what they do
and how they teach you so you
know.

A family is like the stars.
Somehow they’re always there.
Families are those who help,
who support and always care.

But don’t be weary if it's broken
or if through time it’s been so worn
Families are like that they're split up and always torn.

A Family is like a book.
The endings never clear,
but through the pages of the book,
their love is always near.
A family is many things.

But even if this happens,
your family will always be.
They help define just who you are
and will be a part of you eternally.

Family values
A family may provide:
• Identity and sense of belonging
• Protection, support, and reassurance
• Familiarity and sense of certainty
• Unconditional love
• Learning

Family Tension
Tension arises as a result of discrepancy
between:
(Internally)
–The values in your ideal self and those in
your real self; or
(Externally)
–The values that you have and those of
your family; or
–The values that you communicate and
those of your family.

Self-reflection Exercise:
Applying Other-orientation to Family Relationships
• Effective other-orientation requires a consideration of your parents’
backgrounds: their treatment as children by their parents, siblings, and other
relatives; their education and work experiences; and finally, the community
and historical era in which they were raised. Imagine that you are writing a
biography of your parents.
• Ask them about their upbringing, their childhood experiences, their
education, their friends, their challenges – doing so, of course, while using
your best listening skills. Talk to your uncles, aunts, grandparents, parent’s
friends, or older siblings to gain a more complete perspective on your
parents.
• Socially decenter by putting yourself in their situation, imagining what it
would have been like to grow up as they did, to work and raise a family.
• The goal of such reflections is to understand your parents’ behaviors
and the choices they have made in creating a family and raising you.
(Beebe et al., 2011:372)

About the past of yourself / your parents
• Whatever kind of parenting we had, our
parents also are who they are because of
their own life experiences, including the way
they were raised. (Francine Shapiro, 2012:16)
• be gracious
• be forgiving
• be hopeful

About the past of yourself / your parents
• There is no saint without a past, no
sinner without a future.
• -- St. Augustine – an early Christian theologian

• Grace: Loving the unlovely, forgiving the
unforgivable.
• Change is always possible.
•  You have a choice!

One-way communication
• It usually takes less time;
• But it is less accurate;
• Level of confidence of receiver is lower;
• There is more frustration in the receiver.

Two-way communication
• It takes more time but tends to be more accurate;
• The level of confidence of the receiver is higher;
• The sender may be more frustrated in the process.
• It promotes mutual understanding between the
sender and the receiver;
• It builds a more cooperative relationship between
the two.

Describe your own feelings,
rather than evaluate the behavior
of others
• Most people don’t like to be judged or
evaluated.
• Criticizing and name calling obviously can
create relational problems, but so can attempts
to diagnose others’ problems or win their
affection with insincere praise.
• (Beebe et al., 2011:172)

Effective communication - Levelling
• Levelling means telling your partner/friend clearly
and reasonably, how you feel. To do this the use of
"I" messages will be more effective than "you"
messages:
• "I" Messages:
• "I feel upset when you get home from work and just sit in front
of the TV."
• "I feel upset when we do not talk to each other."
• "I feel angry when you are late when we go out."
• "I feel happy when I am in your company.“
• "You" Messages
• "You make me angry."
• "You don't pay me enough attention'
• "You are always late."
• "You make me happy."

Discussion
Are i-statements better or worse than
you-statements? Why?

By emphasizing “I’ and “You”
respectively, what content
(about sources of responsibility)
is communicated?

Verbal Communication
• It is “use of words to convey information”, and can convey
The
implication is even a simple statement can convey rich content
four broad kinds of information:

Cognitive content

Affective content

-Facts (“I have a meeting this Sat”)
-Events (“Your aunt is coming this Sat
too”)
-People (I, mum, family, group mates)
-Things (Project, dinner)

-Open or latent (Open: “I am angry”; Latent:
“I don’t want this to happen neither” (guilty))
-Feelings and Emotions(“Ok! I’ll give up”)

Meaning content

Four kinds
of Contents

Relationship content

-Expressed (“We can’t settle due to -Power (“I am your mother, you
a schedule crash”)
have to listen to me”)
-Implied (Relative importance of
-Control (“Group meeting is a
family to school work)
collective decision that cannot be
changed by me”)

Verbal Communication
The implication is even a simple statement can convey rich content
To manage verbal communication is to handle conveying and
perceiving of the different kinds of content

Don’t you belong to
this family? Your aunt
has not visited us for
years! If you don’t
come this time, don’t
come home ever!

How many kinds of
content can you
identify?
Can you see what is
hidden in the content?
In the parent’s perspective?

Improving Verbal Communication
1. Do not focus on only one kind of content:
 “Don’t come home ever!” can mean many things

2. Pay attention to content that reflects the deepest needs:
 Try this: “I know you feel disappointed in me?” (respond to
affective content)
 Or this: “I know you mean you very much need me to
come?” (respond to meaning content)

3. Focus on the positive side
 “You care so much. I’m part of the family,” “I so much
want to come”, “Let me try sorting it out.”

Skill Practice
• Role-play the scenario again, applying what you’ve learnt in
this lesson:
- Communicate with empathy
What does my parent/son/ daughter need from me?
- Listen very attentively, pay attention to deep content
Avoid keeping saying what you want
Ask questions to clarify misunderstanding
- Respond to deeper needs
Show understanding, care, and respect
Show effort to solve problems

Transactional Analysis
• Transactional Analysis, developed by Eric Bernes, helps to
understand and improve interpersonal communication by
analyzing transactions and their associated ego states.
• There are three ego states:
– Parents (superego; Taught - behaviours, thoughts & feelings copied
from parents or parent figures; learned from external events, etc.)
– Adult (ego; Thought; our ability to think and determine actions
based on received data (like computer processing information);
behaviours, thoughts & feelings which are direct responses to the here
and now. )

– Child (id; Felt, internal reactions and feelings towards external
events from the child, spontaneous behaviours, thought, & feeling
replayed from childhood.)

Complementary Transactions
A Complementary transaction occurs when a message, sent from one
ego state, gets the expected response from a specific complementary
ego state in the other person. This is an effective communication.

(Sympathetically)
Don’t worry. Let
me find it out for
you.

misplaced.

(Worry look)

hour looking

thing too!

Crossed Transactions
Are a frequent source of resentment between people. When one or two
people are unwilling to continue transacting, it is likely that they have
just experienced a crossed transactions.
ineffective communication; either one or both parties would be
upset

Ulterior Transactions
An ulterior transaction have a hidden agenda. The hidden
agenda is like a double message. This ulterior message is more
important to the sender and to the receiver than are the overt,
verbal transactions.
(Frowns)
Ok, here’s your kick.
Sales

but

I’ll take it. It’s just
what I want.

Ulterior Transactions
• A person may use one mode overtly however the covert message
reveals another ego state in operation.

• Such situation often creates a breakdown in communication.
• Mary says, "Do you think we can get this report to the main office by four
o'clock?" reflected by her posture, tone of voice, etc., she actually means
'Stop fooling around and get to work!
• John gets the ulterior message and responds, "I have too much work to do; I
can't do everything" (rebellion).
Mary may then also feel annoyed as she will feel that her question was
perfectly reasonable.

Conclusion
Family is the “factory” where people are made. “We may be the product of
our past, but we are not victims of the past unless we choose to be.”’
(Corey, 2014:398)

The past is the past. We cannot change the past, but we have the right to
choose how we live at present and can change our future.
Do not do unto those close to you which you would not have done unto
others who are not so close to you. (Tal Ben-Shahar)
Don’t take for granted the love of your family members / and do not
vent your negative emotions to your family members, especially your
parents.

Conclusion
Often, the root of the conflict is very simple: people are different in what they
value, and people (including yourself) don’t like their values being confronted.
Two-way communication may cost more effort, but it helps build mutual
understanding.
It is helpful to pay more attention to hidden content in communication and to
respond positively to content which reflects a person’s deep needs.
With understanding and respect, it is possible to live with value differences.
The transactional analysis will be most accurate if non-verbal messages are
also considered.
While the adult-adult complementary transaction is the most constructive
and crossed transactions are the most destructive, ulterior messages are the
heart of all psychological games.
